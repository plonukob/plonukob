## gm! I'm plonukob

I’m a web3 developer creating dev tools (special ZK)

## web3 work

I 🫶🏼 the energy of hackathons. I've entered EthOnline 2021, most recently building Wallet OTP, a decentralized 2FA app. I mentor web3 builders at hackathons, helping them build useful web3 products all over the world

I worked at Polygon Labs, the development and growth team for [Polygon](https://beta.polygon.technology/) and Polygon zkEVM  


## web2 work

👻 Before web3, I was a software developer at Amazon, AWS, SONY, and a few startups. I went full time in web3 during covid after realizing I was spending most of my time exploring and building in the crypto space.
